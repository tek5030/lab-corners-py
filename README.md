# Lab: Estimating circles from corners
In this lab we will
- Create our own corner keypoint detector `CornerDetector`.
- Use detected corner keypoints and the power of RANSAC to find a circle with `CircleEstimator`.

Start by cloning this repository on your machine.
Then, open the project in PyCharm.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:
1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
2. [Implement a corner feature detector](lab-guide/2-implement-a-corner-feature-detector.md)
3. [Detect circles from corners with RANSAC](lab-guide/3-detect-circles-from-corners-with-ransac.md)

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
